## üìÅ Creating Tables

Translated the ERD into actual tables, defining columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Supplier (
    SupplierID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    SupplierName VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    ContactDetails VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Address VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (SupplierID)
);

CREATE TABLE PaymentMethod (
    PaymentMethodID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    MethodName VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    MethodDetails VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Fixed typo from MehtodDetails
    PRIMARY KEY (PaymentMethodID)
);

CREATE TABLE Expense (
    ExpenseID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Description VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Category VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    SupplierID NUMERIC(5),  -- Can be NULL if expense doesn't have a supplier
    PRIMARY KEY (ExpenseID),
    FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES Supplier(SupplierID)
);

CREATE TABLE Tax (
    TaxID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Percentage NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,  -- Changed to support decimals like 10.25%
    TaxAmount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,  -- Changed to NUMERIC for money values
    DueDate DATE NOT NULL,  -- Fixed typo from DoToDate
    PRIMARY KEY (TaxID)
);

CREATE TABLE Transaction (
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,  -- Added DEFAULT for convenience
    Amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (Amount > 0),  -- Added CHECK and changed to NUMERIC
    Status VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pending',  -- Added DEFAULT with common status
    ExpenseID NUMERIC(5),  -- Can be NULL if transaction isn't tied to a specific expense
    PRIMARY KEY (TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ExpenseID) REFERENCES Expense(ExpenseID)
);

CREATE TABLE Invoice (
    InvoiceID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Discount NUMERIC(5,2),  -- Can be NULL if no discount
    Type CHAR(1) NOT NULL CHECK (Type IN ('A', 'D')),  -- Fixed column name from TypeA/D
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (InvoiceID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);

CREATE TABLE Used (
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PaymentMethodID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (TransactionID, PaymentMethodID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PaymentMethodID) REFERENCES PaymentMethod(PaymentMethodID)
);

CREATE TABLE Has (
    TaxID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (TaxID, TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TaxID) REFERENCES Tax(TaxID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);
```

## üî¢ SQL Queries

Practiced writing queries to analyze financial data.

```sql
-- Query to get total expenses per supplier with tax details
SELECT
    s.SupplierName,
    SUM(e.Amount) AS TotalExpense,
    SUM(t.TaxAmount) AS TotalTax,
    t.Percentage
FROM Supplier s
JOIN Expense e ON s.SupplierID = e.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID
GROUP BY s.SupplierName, t.Percentage
ORDER BY TotalExpense DESC;
```

---

## üìä Stored Procedures and Functions

Created a stored procedure to calculate total tax for a given transaction.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(p_TransactionID INTEGER)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_TotalTax DECIMAL;
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(TaxAmount) INTO v_TotalTax
    FROM Tax
    WHERE TransactionID = p_TransactionID;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Total Tax for Transaction %: %', p_TransactionID, v_TotalTax;
END;
$$;

-- Call it:
CALL CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(1);
```

---

## üîç Views

Created a view to simplify querying expense, supplier, and tax details.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ExpenseSummary AS
SELECT
    e.ExpenseID,
    e.Description,
    e.Category,
    s.SupplierName,
    tr.Amount,
    t.TaxAmount,
    t.Percentage
FROM Expense e
JOIN Supplier s ON e.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID;

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM ExpenseSummary;
```

## üßπ Stage C ‚Äì Integration & Views

This stage focuses on integrating two separate database systems: the **Financial System** and the **Reception System**, into a unified database model. The integration was achieved using PostgreSQL‚Äôs `postgres_fdw` extension. Additionally, two views were created ‚Äî one for each subsystem ‚Äî along with meaningful queries to demonstrate data accessibility and insight generation.

---

### ü¶á Integration Strategy

#### üö™ Databases Involved:

* **db5785\_4051\_8145** ‚Äì Financial Database (our original project)
* **DB25785\_4051\_8145** ‚Äì Reception Database (received from another team)

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:

* PostgreSQL
* ERDPlus (for ERD & DSD modeling)
* `postgres_fdw` (Foreign Data Wrapper)
* Git for version control (`stage-c` tag)

---

### üó± Step-by-Step Integration Workflow

1. **DSD Creation from Reception DB**
   We received a backup of the Reception system and reverse-engineered the table structures to build its **DSD**.

2. **ERD Reverse Engineering**
   From the DSD, we created a logical **ERD** for the reception system, identifying key entities like `reservations`, `guests`, `rooms`, and `checkinout`.

3. **Designing the Unified ERD**
   We merged our **Financial ERD** with the **Reception ERD**, making key design decisions to:

   * Avoid data duplication
   * Use *foreign tables* instead of direct duplication
   * Introduce **linking tables** (e.g., `reservationfinancelink`)
   * Add **sync-tracking** functionality (`reservationsync`)

   üì∏ See:

   * `/images/integration/reception_erd.png`
   * `/images/integration/combined_erd.png`

4. **Implementing Integration**
   Using the `Integrate.sql` script:

   * Enabled `postgres_fdw`
   * Created a `FOREIGN SERVER` to the reception database
   * Imported foreign tables: `guests`, `rooms`, `reservations`, `checkinout`
   * Renamed them with a `foreign_` prefix
   * Created `reservationfinancelink` and `reservationsync` tables
   * Populated the linking tables with test data
   * Indexed fields for performance
   * Verified the integration with `SELECT` diagnostics

---

### üìÇ Key Integration Tables

#### `reservationfinancelink`

Links a reservation (reception) to a financial transaction (finance).

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservationfinancelink (
    link_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    reservation_id NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    transaction_id NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (transaction_id) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);
```

#### `reservationsync`

Captures a snapshot of reservation and payment summary for syncing and reporting.

---

### üëÅÔ∏è Views & Analytical Queries

We created two views ‚Äî each from the perspective of a different department.

#### üìò View 1: `financial_reservation_view`

Shows detailed reservation and payment status ‚Äî for use by the finance team. Combines room pricing, invoice discounts, and payment status.

##### üîç Queries on Financial View:

* **Query 1.1 ‚Äì Outstanding Payments**
  Shows guests with unpaid or pending reservations.
* **Query 1.2 ‚Äì Revenue by Room Type**
  Aggregates expected vs actual revenue, with discount analysis.

üì∏ Screenshot: `/images/views/financial_view_sample.png`

---

#### üìó View 2: `reception_occupancy_financial_view`

Aggregates room utilization and revenue status. Helps reception manage occupancy and payment collection status.

##### üîç Queries on Reception View:

* **Query 2.1 ‚Äì Room Performance Summary**
  Combines total bookings, current occupancy, and revenue.
* **Query 2.2 ‚Äì Payment Status Alerts**
  Identifies rooms with payment issues (e.g., pending payments).

üì∏ Screenshot: `/images/views/reception_view_sample.png`

---

### üìå Design Decisions

* **Foreign Tables vs Physical Merge**: We opted to *import foreign tables* instead of duplicating the structure. This maintains source-of-truth separation.
* **Naming Conventions**: Added `foreign_` prefix to imported tables for clarity.
* **Linking Tables**: Used minimal tables (`reservationfinancelink`) to connect subsystems.
* **Sync Snapshots**: `reservationsync` stores calculated results for fast reporting.
