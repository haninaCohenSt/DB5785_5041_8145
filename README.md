# üìù Workshop Files & Scripts (Hanina Cohen & Oded Ofek) üßì‚Äçüéì

This workshop introduces key database concepts and provides hands-on practice in a controlled, containerized environment using PostgreSQL within Docker. Our project focuses on the financial part of a hotel management system, where we designed and implemented a database to track expenses, transactions, invoices, taxes, and payment methods. Below are the details of our implementation.

## üìÅ Creating Tables

Translated the ERD into actual tables, defining columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Supplier (
    SupplierID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    SupplierName VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    ContactDetails VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Address VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (SupplierID)
);

CREATE TABLE PaymentMethod (
    PaymentMethodID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    MethodName VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    MethodDetails VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Fixed typo from MehtodDetails
    PRIMARY KEY (PaymentMethodID)
);

CREATE TABLE Expense (
    ExpenseID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Description VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Category VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    SupplierID NUMERIC(5),  -- Can be NULL if expense doesn't have a supplier
    PRIMARY KEY (ExpenseID),
    FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES Supplier(SupplierID)
);

CREATE TABLE Tax (
    TaxID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Percentage NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,  -- Changed to support decimals like 10.25%
    TaxAmount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,  -- Changed to NUMERIC for money values
    DueDate DATE NOT NULL,  -- Fixed typo from DoToDate
    PRIMARY KEY (TaxID)
);

CREATE TABLE Transaction (
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,  -- Added DEFAULT for convenience
    Amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (Amount > 0),  -- Added CHECK and changed to NUMERIC
    Status VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pending',  -- Added DEFAULT with common status
    ExpenseID NUMERIC(5),  -- Can be NULL if transaction isn't tied to a specific expense
    PRIMARY KEY (TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ExpenseID) REFERENCES Expense(ExpenseID)
);

CREATE TABLE Invoice (
    InvoiceID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Discount NUMERIC(5,2),  -- Can be NULL if no discount
    Type CHAR(1) NOT NULL CHECK (Type IN ('A', 'D')),  -- Fixed column name from TypeA/D
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (InvoiceID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);

CREATE TABLE Used (
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PaymentMethodID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (TransactionID, PaymentMethodID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PaymentMethodID) REFERENCES PaymentMethod(PaymentMethodID)
);

CREATE TABLE Has (
    TaxID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (TaxID, TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TaxID) REFERENCES Tax(TaxID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);
```

## üî¢ SQL Queries

Practiced writing queries to analyze financial data.

```sql
-- Query to get total expenses per supplier with tax details
SELECT
    s.SupplierName,
    SUM(e.Amount) AS TotalExpense,
    SUM(t.TaxAmount) AS TotalTax,
    t.Percentage
FROM Supplier s
JOIN Expense e ON s.SupplierID = e.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID
GROUP BY s.SupplierName, t.Percentage
ORDER BY TotalExpense DESC;
```

---

## üìä Stored Procedures and Functions

Created a stored procedure to calculate total tax for a given transaction.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(p_TransactionID INTEGER)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_TotalTax DECIMAL;
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(TaxAmount) INTO v_TotalTax
    FROM Tax
    WHERE TransactionID = p_TransactionID;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Total Tax for Transaction %: %', p_TransactionID, v_TotalTax;
END;
$$;

-- Call it:
CALL CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(1);
```

---

## üîç Views

Created a view to simplify querying expense, supplier, and tax details.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ExpenseSummary AS
SELECT
    e.ExpenseID,
    e.Description,
    e.Category,
    s.SupplierName,
    tr.Amount,
    t.TaxAmount,
    t.Percentage
FROM Expense e
JOIN Supplier s ON e.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID;

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM ExpenseSummary;
```
## üìò Stage B ‚Äì Queries, Constraints, and Transactions

This stage focuses on querying the database, enforcing integrity constraints, and demonstrating transactional control. The work in this stage reflects the business logic needed for interacting with the financial subsystem of our hotel management system.

### üîç SQL Queries
