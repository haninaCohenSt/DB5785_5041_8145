# 📝 Workshop Files & Scripts (Hanina Cohen & Oded Ofek) 🧓‍🎓

This workshop introduces key database concepts and provides hands-on practice in a controlled, containerized environment using PostgreSQL within Docker. Our project focuses on the financial part of a hotel management system, where we designed and implemented a database to track expenses, transactions, invoices, taxes, and payment methods. Below are the details of our implementation.

## 🛠️ Table Relationships with Notation

| Relationship Name | From (Entity) | To (Entity)     | Cardinality     | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GetPaidBy`       | `Expense`     | `Supplier`      | `0..N` → `0..1` | A supplier may be linked to many expenses, and an expense may optionally have a supplier. |
| `Involves`        | `Expense`     | `Transaction`   | `1` → `1`       | Every expense must be linked to exactly one transaction.                                  |
| `GeneratedBy`     | `Transaction` | `Invoice`       | `0..1` ↔ `0..1` | A transaction may optionally generate one invoice and vice versa.                         |
| `Used`            | `Transaction` | `PaymentMethod` | `0..N` → `1`    | Each transaction uses exactly one payment method, which may be used by many transactions. |
| `Has`             | `Transaction` | `Tax`           | `0..1` ← `0..N` | A transaction can have many taxes; each tax belongs to exactly one transaction.           |

**Legend:**

* `1`: Exactly one (mandatory)
* `0..1`: Zero or one (optional)
* `0..N`: Zero or many (optional)
* `1..N`: One or many (at least one, mandatory)
* `↔`: Bidirectional

## 📁 Creating Tables

Translated the ERD into actual tables, defining columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.

```sql
-- Supplier Table
CREATE TABLE Supplier (
    SupplierID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    SupplierName TEXT NOT NULL,
    ContactDetails TEXT,
    Address TEXT
);

-- Expense Table
CREATE TABLE Expense (
    ExpenseID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Description TEXT,
    Category TEXT,
    TransactionID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    SupplierID INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES Supplier(SupplierID)
);

-- Transaction Table
CREATE TABLE Transaction (
    TransactionID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Amount DECIMAL NOT NULL,
    Status TEXT,
    PaymentMethodID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    InvoiceID INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (PaymentMethodID) REFERENCES PaymentMethod(PaymentMethodID),
    FOREIGN KEY (InvoiceID) REFERENCES Invoice(InvoiceID)
);

-- Invoice Table
CREATE TABLE Invoice (
    InvoiceID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Discount DECIMAL,
    TypeAD TEXT
);

-- PaymentMethod Table
CREATE TABLE PaymentMethod (
    PaymentMethodID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    MethodName TEXT NOT NULL,
    MethodDetails TEXT
);

-- Tax Table
CREATE TABLE Tax (
    TaxID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    TransactionID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    Percentage DECIMAL,
    TaxAmount DECIMAL,
    DoToDate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);
```

## 🔢 SQL Queries

Practiced writing queries to analyze financial data.

```sql
-- Query to get total expenses per supplier with tax details
SELECT
    s.SupplierName,
    SUM(e.Amount) AS TotalExpense,
    SUM(t.TaxAmount) AS TotalTax,
    t.Percentage
FROM Supplier s
JOIN Expense e ON s.SupplierID = e.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID
GROUP BY s.SupplierName, t.Percentage
ORDER BY TotalExpense DESC;
```

---

## 📊 Stored Procedures and Functions

Created a stored procedure to calculate total tax for a given transaction.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(p_TransactionID INTEGER)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_TotalTax DECIMAL;
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(TaxAmount) INTO v_TotalTax
    FROM Tax
    WHERE TransactionID = p_TransactionID;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Total Tax for Transaction %: %', p_TransactionID, v_TotalTax;
END;
$$;

-- Call it:
CALL CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(1);
```

---

## 🔍 Views

Created a view to simplify querying expense, supplier, and tax details.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ExpenseSummary AS
SELECT
    e.ExpenseID,
    e.Description,
    e.Category,
    s.SupplierName,
    tr.Amount,
    t.TaxAmount,
    t.Percentage
FROM Expense e
JOIN Supplier s ON e.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID;

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM ExpenseSummary;
```
