## üìÅ Creating Tables

Translated the ERD into actual tables, defining columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Supplier (
    SupplierID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    SupplierName VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    ContactDetails VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Address VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (SupplierID)
);

CREATE TABLE PaymentMethod (
    PaymentMethodID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    MethodName VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    MethodDetails VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Fixed typo from MehtodDetails
    PRIMARY KEY (PaymentMethodID)
);

CREATE TABLE Expense (
    ExpenseID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Description VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Category VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    SupplierID NUMERIC(5),  -- Can be NULL if expense doesn't have a supplier
    PRIMARY KEY (ExpenseID),
    FOREIGN KEY (SupplierID) REFERENCES Supplier(SupplierID)
);

CREATE TABLE Tax (
    TaxID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Percentage NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,  -- Changed to support decimals like 10.25%
    TaxAmount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,  -- Changed to NUMERIC for money values
    DueDate DATE NOT NULL,  -- Fixed typo from DoToDate
    PRIMARY KEY (TaxID)
);

CREATE TABLE Transaction (
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,  -- Added DEFAULT for convenience
    Amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (Amount > 0),  -- Added CHECK and changed to NUMERIC
    Status VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pending',  -- Added DEFAULT with common status
    ExpenseID NUMERIC(5),  -- Can be NULL if transaction isn't tied to a specific expense
    PRIMARY KEY (TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ExpenseID) REFERENCES Expense(ExpenseID)
);

CREATE TABLE Invoice (
    InvoiceID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    Discount NUMERIC(5,2),  -- Can be NULL if no discount
    Type CHAR(1) NOT NULL CHECK (Type IN ('A', 'D')),  -- Fixed column name from TypeA/D
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (InvoiceID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);

CREATE TABLE Used (
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PaymentMethodID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (TransactionID, PaymentMethodID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PaymentMethodID) REFERENCES PaymentMethod(PaymentMethodID)
);

CREATE TABLE Has (
    TaxID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    TransactionID NUMERIC(5) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (TaxID, TransactionID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TaxID) REFERENCES Tax(TaxID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TransactionID) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);
```

## üî¢ SQL Queries

Practiced writing queries to analyze financial data.

```sql
-- Query to get total expenses per supplier with tax details
SELECT
    s.SupplierName,
    SUM(e.Amount) AS TotalExpense,
    SUM(t.TaxAmount) AS TotalTax,
    t.Percentage
FROM Supplier s
JOIN Expense e ON s.SupplierID = e.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID
GROUP BY s.SupplierName, t.Percentage
ORDER BY TotalExpense DESC;
```

---

## üìä Stored Procedures and Functions

Created a stored procedure to calculate total tax for a given transaction.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(p_TransactionID INTEGER)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_TotalTax DECIMAL;
BEGIN
    SELECT SUM(TaxAmount) INTO v_TotalTax
    FROM Tax
    WHERE TransactionID = p_TransactionID;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Total Tax for Transaction %: %', p_TransactionID, v_TotalTax;
END;
$$;

-- Call it:
CALL CalculateTotalTaxForTransaction(1);
```

---

## üîç Views

Created a view to simplify querying expense, supplier, and tax details.

```sql
CREATE VIEW ExpenseSummary AS
SELECT
    e.ExpenseID,
    e.Description,
    e.Category,
    s.SupplierName,
    tr.Amount,
    t.TaxAmount,
    t.Percentage
FROM Expense e
JOIN Supplier s ON e.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
JOIN Transaction tr ON e.TransactionID = tr.TransactionID
JOIN Tax t ON tr.TransactionID = t.TransactionID;

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM ExpenseSummary;
```
## üìò Stage B ‚Äì Queries, Constraints, and Transactions

# üìò Stage C ‚Äì Integration and Views

This stage focuses on integrating our financial management system with another hotel department's database system. We created a backup of the Reception department's database and performed a complete integration process, creating views and complex queries that span both systems.

---

## üîÑ Integration Process Overview

### Step 1: Creating a database to perform integration

We created another database to integrate with it.

**Reception Department DSD:**
![Reception DSD](ex3/DSD.png)

### Step 2: Creating ERD from Reception DSD

From the DSD analysis, we created the ERD for the Reception department to understand the relationships and entities.

**Reception Department ERD:**
![Reception ERD](ex3/ERD.png)

### Step 3: Integrated ERD Design

We designed a combined ERD that integrates both the Financial and Reception departments, making key design decisions about relationships and data flow.

**Integrated ERD:**
![Integrated ERD](ex3/◊§◊®◊°◊ï◊ù1.jpg)

### Step 4: Final Integrated DSD

The final database structure after integration, showing all tables and relationships.

**Final Integrated DSD:**
![Final DSD](ex3/BIGDSD.png)

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration Implementation

### Integration SQL Commands

```sql
-- Enable Foreign Data Wrapper
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgres_fdw;

-- Create Foreign Server Connection
CREATE SERVER reception_server
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
OPTIONS (host 'localhost', port '5432', dbname 'DB25785_4051_8145');

-- Create User Mapping for Authentication
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR CURRENT_USER
SERVER reception_server
OPTIONS (user 'postgres', password '123');

-- Import Foreign Schema
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public
LIMIT TO (guests, rooms, reservations, checkinout)
FROM SERVER reception_server
INTO public;

-- Rename Foreign Tables
ALTER FOREIGN TABLE guests RENAME TO foreign_guests;
ALTER FOREIGN TABLE rooms RENAME TO foreign_rooms;
ALTER FOREIGN TABLE reservations RENAME TO foreign_reservations;
ALTER FOREIGN TABLE checkinout RENAME TO foreign_checkinout;

-- Create Integration Tables
CREATE TABLE reservationfinancelink (
    link_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    reservation_id numeric NOT NULL,
    transaction_id numeric NOT NULL,
    created_date timestamp without time zone DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT fk_transaction FOREIGN KEY (transaction_id) REFERENCES Transaction(TransactionID)
);

CREATE TABLE reservationsync (
    reservation_id numeric NOT NULL,
    guest_name character varying,
    room_number numeric,
    check_in_date date,
    check_out_date date,
    total_amount numeric,
    sync_date timestamp without time zone DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## üëÅÔ∏è Views Implementation

### View 1: Financial Department Perspective
**View Name:** `financial_reservation_view`

This view provides the financial department with a comprehensive overview of all reservations and their associated financial transactions, including payment status and expected vs. actual amounts.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW financial_reservation_view AS
SELECT 
    r.reservation_id,
    (g.first_name || ' ' || g.last_name) AS guest_name,
    r.room_number,
    ro.room_type,
    r.check_in_date,
    r.check_out_date,
    r.reservation_status,
    (ro.price_per_night * ((r.check_out_date - r.check_in_date)::numeric)) AS expected_amount,
    t.transactionid,
    t.amount AS paid_amount,
    t.status AS payment_status,
    t.date AS payment_date,
    i.invoiceid,
    i.discount,
    CASE
        WHEN t.transactionid IS NULL THEN 'Not Paid'
        WHEN t.status = 'Completed' THEN 'Paid'
        WHEN t.status = 'Pending' THEN 'Pending Payment'
        WHEN t.status = 'Approved' THEN 'Approved'
        WHEN t.status = 'Rejected' THEN 'Rejected'
        ELSE t.status
    END AS payment_summary
FROM foreign_reservations r
JOIN foreign_guests g ON r.guest_id = g.guest_id
JOIN foreign_rooms ro ON r.room_number = ro.room_number
LEFT JOIN reservationfinancelink rfl ON r.reservation_id = rfl.reservation_id
LEFT JOIN transaction t ON rfl.transaction_id = t.transactionid
LEFT JOIN invoice i ON t.transactionid = i.transactionid;
```

**View Description:** This view combines reservation data with financial transaction details, allowing the finance department to track expected vs. actual payments, identify outstanding balances, and monitor payment statuses across all guest reservations. The view includes calculated fields for payment summaries and expected amounts based on room rates and stay duration.

**Sample Data from View:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM financial_reservation_view LIMIT 10;
```

![](ex3/◊¶◊ô◊ú◊ï◊ù ◊û◊°◊ö 2025-07-01 191150.png)


### View 2: Reception Department Perspective
**View Name:** `reception_occupancy_financial_view`
